Architectural Assesment
Compliance with ING Standarts
The product developed in the project is compatible with ING security standarts. From the scalibility perspective the product is not
reusable globally and itâ€™s not running on TPA environment. This product is pure local solution developed in local systems.
Impact Assesment of The Proposed Solution
The systems are designed in accordance with ING minimum standards to handle high volume traffic and transactions. These
systems are scaled according to the increasing number of customers. Since the proposed solution will be used by existing
customers and our rate of increase in customers are certain, no negative impact is expected regarding connections and load.
